# Data Analysis Repository

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and resources developed for my university Data Analysis class. The main project is focused on the weather-accident correlation study in the `project/` folder. The other folders and files were practical exercises to explore the context and practice data analysis techniques.

## Structure
- **Data_Preparation/**: Practice notebooks and scripts for exploring data cleaning and preparation techniques.
- **Data_Integration/**: Practice notebooks and scripts for merging and integrating datasets.
- **Data_Quality/**: Practice notebooks and visualizations for assessing and improving data quality.
- **Data_Vizualization/**: Practice notebooks and images for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- **project/**: Analysis scripts and notebooks for the weather-accident correlation study, including:
  - Data cleaning pipelines for US accidents and weather datasets
  - Visualization scripts for accident patterns
  - Weather-accident correlation analysis
  - Generated plots and statistical results
- **dataset/**: Input and processed datasets used throughout the practice exercises.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter (see `requirements.txt` for details)

## Usage
Open the notebooks in Jupyter or run the Python scripts as needed to reproduce the analyses and visualizations.
